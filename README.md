# Home automation
A collection of all my home automation projects in home assistant.

## The projects as of now are:
### Smartphone smart displays
I wanted to repurpose some of my old android phones as smart displays. Above you can find my 3D designs for smartphoene mounts: One wallmount and one nightlamp mount. I use [this](https://wallpanel.xyz/) app on the phones to turn them into smart displays.

### Home assistant morning alarm
This project has it's own repo [here](https://github.com/tobiashellerslien/Home_assistant_morning_alarm)
